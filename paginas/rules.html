    <h1>Basic Rules</h1>
    <h2>A Poker Style Card Game</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the last defense against the invasion of the Chaos Leaders.
        In this game, each player receives five cards and has to form sets of heroes to face the hordes of Chaos Leaders.
        Just like in a Poker game, the player must form pairs, trips and other combinations to use the Heroes' abilities.
    </p>
    <h2 class="separador">&#10097; Game Setup &#10096;</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate the hero cards, shuffle them and form a pile;</li>
            <li>Separate the opponents' cards by their backs, which contain a coin. They must be separated according to the value of each. The coins without values are the starting cards.</li>
            <li>Separate the Leaders by forming a line, in numerical order, according to the number of the coin on the back.</li>
            <li>Shuffle the other cards and place them on the corresponding leader.</li>
            <li>Form a pile with the opponent's cards, with the coin face up, and the highest value at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Arrange the initial cards in a 3 x 3 grid.</li>
            <li>Each player receives five hero cards.</li>
            <li>Each player will face a row of 3 cards. This line will be considered your first line, where most effects resolve. Each player will have a different first lines.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <img src="../imagems/grid.png" alt="Grid of War" id="grid_war">
    <p>The player receives 5 cards and needs to make combinations between them to activate their heroes' abilities. Combinations such as <strong>pairs</strong> and <strong>triplets</strong> activate simpler abilities; Getting a sequence of <strong>four</strong> or <strong>five</strong> cards with one of a kind has a stronger effect.</p>
