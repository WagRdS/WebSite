    <h2>Minions of the Leaders of Chaos, their role is to annihilate anyone who tries to stop their masters' plans.</h2>
    <p>At the end of the player's turn, the remaining minions in the first row deal damage, as described below.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two level 1 minions deal 1 damage</li>
        <li>Each level 2 minion deal 1 damage</li>
        <li>Each level 3 minion deal 2 damage</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
    <p>When a minion is defeated, its card is placed in the Reward Pile in front of the player with the coin facing up.
    </p>
    <p>For a new opponent to enter, move one from the second row to the first row and place a new one in the open space. This rule applies when more than one opponent is defeated in one turn. Leaders always enter the center of the field.</p>
